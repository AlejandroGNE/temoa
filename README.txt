 # Take a look at scenariodata/ and a couple of the examples in the
 # subdirs:
$ ls -lh scenariodata


  # To run with one of the examples (CO2):
$ runph --model-directory=models --instance-directory=scenariodata/co2 --verbose


Note also, that this is still preliminary, so please don't get angry
if it doesn't work.  Get helpful.
